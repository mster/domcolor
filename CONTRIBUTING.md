# Contributing

Thanks for checking out domcolor!

### Getting Started

1. Fork domcolor and run `npm install` within the directory.
2. On your fork, create a new branch named `username/work-description`, where `username` is your GitHub username and `work-description` is a short description for your contribution.

   For example: `mster/new-mode`

3. Commit your work to the branch you created.
4. When you're ready for review or to submit your contribution, make sure your fork is up to date and that your code pases `npm test`. If your fork is out of date, you will need to rebase.
5. If your change is in multiple commits, you will need to squash them into a single commit.
6. Open a pull request to `dev/latest`.
